# Pima Indians Diabetes Database

We will use **Pima Indians Diabetes Database** that is publicly available and from UCI. However, we removed and changed some parts of the dataset for the homework evaluation, so **please use the one in the zip file provided in ilearn**.

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on specific diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

The dataset consists of several medical predictors (independent) variables and one target (dependent) variable, Outcome. Independent variables include the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

## Dataset Information

- **Pregnancies**: Number of times pregnant.
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.

- **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
- **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: Diabetes pedigree function.
- **Age**: Age (years).
